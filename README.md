# Natural_calamity_detection_from_tweets

This is done as part of my research internship at Amrita Center for Wireless Networks and Applications (https://www.amrita.edu/center/awna)

Twitter, a popular service for sending and receiving short, public text messages, can augment landslide response and the delivery of hazard information. Rapid detection and qualitative assessment of a natural calamities are possible because people begin sending public Twitter messages (tweets) within tens of seconds of experiencing a natural calamity. Here we present and evaluate natural calamities detection procedure that relies solely on Twitter data.The detections are fast; about 75% occur within two minutes of the origin time. This is considerably faster than sensor detections in poorly instrumented regions of the country. The tweets triggering the detections can also provide very short first-impression narratives from people who experience it.
